#Numerical Integration

**Inputs:**
X - x values of the data table
Y - y values of the data table
**Outputs:**
I - approximate integral of the given data

This algorithm uses Simpson’s ⅓ rule to approximate the integral of a data table. It is good for fast approximations but does not include a component that calculates approximate error. 

Note: This algorithm uses the trapezoidal rule on the last interval if there are an odd number of intervals between data points. The user is warned in these cases.
