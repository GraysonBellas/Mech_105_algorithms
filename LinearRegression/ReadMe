#Linear Regression

**Inputs:** 
X - x values of the data table
Y - y values of the data table
**Outputs:**
fX - sorted x values with outliers removed
fY - sorted y values with outliers removed
Slope - slope of the linear regression
Intercept -intercept of the linear regression
Rsquared -R^2 a.k.a coefficient of determination

This algorithm is used to find the linear regression of a data set. It automatically sorts the data and removes outliers according to the Mendenhall and Sincich definition. It also calculates the Rsquared value. 

Note: This algorithm does not linearize the data and therefore should only be used for linear relationships.
